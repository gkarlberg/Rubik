# Rubik
Python scripts to virtually manipulate the 2x2x2 cube

Rubik.py - This file contains all methods to manipulate the cube. Note also the methods for printing out the cube state and telling if states are equal.
RubikApp.py - This is a program to perform a given number of random operations on the cube and for instance see a histogram of the how many correct colors there were. If the cube is solved it prints the N last operations.
RubikSequences.py - This program tries to find all sequences consisting of 8 turns that leave the bottom layer without changes. Not finsihed yet. 
RubikTests.py - A few unit tests to verify that the implemented rotations behave as expected.
